<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>It is only right to acknowledge my indebtedness
in the compilation of this volume to John
Forster, to whom as one of the most courageous,
industrious, and sympathetic of the writers of
biography, all students of Goldsmith must be
profoundly grateful. To several other writers
I must also express my thanks, and to save the
time of my kind readers and to preserve a
proper sense of obligation, it would perhaps
be best to admit at once that if this little book
has any merits, they are due to others, while
its errors are all my own.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>"THE BEST BELOVED OF ENGLISH WRITERS"</h3>


<p>The Goldsmith family sprang originally
from Crayford, a nestling village in Kent.
This southern county, in all its loveliness, can
thus add this high honour to its other though
not greater glories. "To be the best beloved
of English writers," said Thackeray, "what a
title that is for a man!" This he gave to Goldsmith.
It is a title that none will dispute.
Here is a love that will never pass away from
our hearts. Of Oliver Goldsmith, as poet and
novelist, essay-writer, wit and playwright, it
may be said that his distinction and celebrity
are essentially English. Erin, sweet sister
island, that land of loving hearts, gave this
child of sun and shade, his birthplace, his
home and many dear delightful days, never to
be forgotten. Across the separating years, to
the very end and through all, the grateful heart
of the poet looked back very fondly upon the
gentle and pathetic land of his nativity. On
November 10, 1728, Oliver Goldsmith first saw
the light of that world which, to the last, he
loved, and greeted that suffering heart and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
seeking aspiration of humanity, that above
and beyond almost all other men he could, and
did, unfailingly compassionate. It is needless
to trace and recall, the ancestral traditions of
the Goldsmith family. Of its early history in
England and later settlement in Ireland, it will
suffice that its annals are as honourable as they
are obscure. It had its men of light and learning,
but their power attained neither fame nor
rank, and their virtues were rather domestic
than distinguished.</p>

<p>The family, which flowers in the delightful
novelist and playwright, was ever famed for
goodness of heart and the possession of the
very smallest possible sum total of worldly
prudence. Goldsmith was named Oliver, after
Oliver Jones, his grandfather. Noll held that
Miss Ann Jones, his mother, was descended
from a Huntingdon stock, and that the name
Oliver came from no ancestor less celebrated
than the Great Protector. Whilst this may be
felicitously fanciful, and quite in character with
dear Noll, who, doting upon every form of
finery, whether it came from illustrious ancestry
or coloured clothes, certainly had a face not
unlike in contour and feature, the rugged
countenance of Cromwell.</p>

<p>Goldsmith was born in the remote village of
Pallasmore, in the county of Longford, Ireland.
This district has been called the very midmost
solitude. Oliver's father was the Vicar of the
parish. Three daughters and one son preceded
the appearance of little Noll in the parsonage
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
at Pallasmore. He was followed by three more
brothers, making in all a happy family of eight,
of whom two died in childhood.</p>

<p>In 1730 the Rev. Charles Goldsmith was
preferred from Pallas to the living of Kilkenny
West. The parsonage connected with this
better benefice was situated at Lissoy, the
Immortal Village. Here Oliver's childhood
was passed. Unlike Pallasmore, this was a
picturesque place in the centre of a fair and
goodly land. No poem opens more sweetly
than that which heralds its message:</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"Sweet Auburn, loveliest village."<br />
</p></div>

<p>The Vicar's meagre income as a country
pastor was increased by farming, and vastly
diminished by his open-hearted, swift responsiveness
to every sudden or permanent appeal
to his purse, the family wardrobe, or the larder.
In this excellent and honoured man, whose
very piety was as sublime as it was confused,
rambling, and paradoxical, we have the quaint
original of Dr. Primrose, one of the most lovable
characters that has ever lived to charm
the page of lasting literature.</p>

<p>In the family life at Lissoy one little child
strikes us all with deepest interest and love,
and yet he was an oddity to those who knew
him, not as we do now, but as he was&mdash;a dull
boy, and quite a "blockhead in book-learning."</p>

<p>The master at the village school had been
a soldier under the Duke of Marlborough ere
he returned to what had been his earlier vocation,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
that of a pedagogue. He was a rough
diamond, yet most revered, with great kindness
in his heart. His love of poetry inspired his
pupils as much as his stories of campaigns.
He had an excellent literary taste. If Goldsmith
even when a boy valued this old friend,
Paddy Byrne not less saw the goodness,
the hidden power, and the brightness of the
child. Noll was soon taken away from the
village school. Just at the moment when
the heart of the master had greeted the hope
of his little scholar, Oliver caught confluent
smallpox, with the pathetic result that a face
plain to begin with, grew a whimsical and winsome
ugliness all its own. Goldsmith has given
us more than one friend, and not the least of
these old Paddy Byrne:</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"Beside yon straggling fence that skirts the way,<br />
With blossom'd furze unprofitably gay,<br />
There, in his noisy mansion, skilled to rule,<br />
The village master taught his little school.<br />
A man severe he was, and stern to view;<br />
I knew him well, and every truant knew."<br />
</p></div>

<p>Then we are told:</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"Full well they laughed with counterfeited glee<br />
At all his jokes&mdash;for many a joke had he&mdash;<br />
Full well the busy whisper circling round<br />
Conveyed the dismal tidings when he frowned."<br />
</p></div>

<p>As the piece proceeds, the delicately chiding
satire is delightful, ringing at last with the
laughing lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"And still they gazed, and still their wonder grew,<br />
That one small head could carry all he knew."<br />
</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Seven years had elapsed between the birth
of Oliver and the child that preceded him.
His elder brother Henry had superior qualities
which were early marked. To these his father
gave great attention, lavishing his means upon
this boy's education. Oliver was destined for
commercial life in the paternal projection of
those affairs and eventualities of which men
imagine they are masters. The force of impressions
that fall upon the mind in childhood
must be strongest in those children whose
imaginations are most vivid. Listening to
Paddy Byrne made Oliver in heart and mind
a wayward rover all his life. Something of
the imprudence of the little man came, it might
be said, from this dash of the recklessness of
the old soldier and adventurer infused into
imaginative infant hopefulness. From this
same instructor he also gathered his devotion
to books and poetry, which proved a revelation
that changed his father's purpose of fitting him
for a commercial calling.</p>

<p>Henry Goldsmith is known and remembered
now through the poetic expressions of honour
and affection bestowed upon him by his brother.
One cannot tell at this hour whether the deeper
sense of reverence should fall upon his character
or upon that gratitude through which alone it
lives.</p>

<p>In the childhood of Oliver Goldsmith, his
brightness and the foreshadowings of future
force were not alone among the elements within
the little heart which lay neglected by those he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
loved and whose lives he lighted, though they
knew it not. In due course he was despatched
to another school, thirty miles away. He
lived with his uncle, Mr. John Goldsmith, a
landed gentleman, and attended the school at
Elphin; and at eleven years of age was sent
to another and a more reputed Academy nearer
home, at Athlone. Two years here and four at
Edgeworthstown completed his schooling at the
age of seventeen.</p>

<p>Of the Vicar of Wakefield, and thence of the
father of little Oliver, it was said that all his
adventures were by his own fireside, and all
his travels from one room to another. He was
in all likelihood a delicate man, and certainly
deeply religious, with a high sense of honour
and common moral obligation. The <i>Vicar of
Wakefield</i>, his best portrait, stands an honourable
and an imperishable filial tribute, the
fairest ever paid by son to sire.</p>

<p>One day, when this young Master Goldsmith
was in his teens, he left home for Edgeworthstown,
riding a good horse, borrowed from a
friend, and in high glee, if money braces the
manly heart. With a golden guinea in his
purse, he was as proud as wealth untold can
make a buoyant spirit, in the days when life is
very bright and happiness is everywhere. He
loitered on the journey. The horse nigh slept,
whilst the rider mooned on in meditative peace,
and a lad's romantic building up of airy castellations.
Instead of achieving his actual destination
by nightfall, he was still miles away from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
the appointed place. Nothing daunted, with a
proud and mighty air, he paused in the streets
of Ardagh to ask a wayfarer where he could
find the best house of entertainment. This
question, it happened, was addressed to the
greatest wag in the vicinity.</p>

<p>The wit, a jocose fencing-master, Mr. Cornelius
Kelly, now fenced with words, and in all
his life never did defter work. He pointed to
the house of old Squire Featherston, rightly
averring no better entertainment or hospitality
could be found anywhere in all the world than
in that generous and hearty home. Thus mistaking
this private house and family mansion
for an inn, the youth approached the place, and
the wag went on his way. Oliver gave the
bell a good ring, told the man to take his horse,
and sauntered into the commodious parlour of
the Squire as if it had been the public room in
some well-supplied hotel. The Squire soon
detected the mistake that had been made, and
knowing the father of the boy, seized upon the
diverting situation, entering with all his heart
into the possibilities the joke might yield. He
turned landlord for the nonce, brought in the
supper piping hot, and then was ordered to
bring a bottle of good wine. This the lad cordially,
yet with some condescension, shared
with the supposed master of the hostelry.
More than this, at last putting all pride of
place aside, he told the good man to bring
his wife and daughter to the table. Oliver
gave minute and particular orders for a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
good breakfast on the morrow, and then went
to bed.</p>

<p>We can picture the sweetly smiling daughter
of the Squire, rippling with laughter and every
moment more bewitching.</p>

<p>We wonder what this prototype of Miss
Hardcastle was like to look upon, and whether
her heart was as tender, and her wit and grace
as charming, as that of the character she at
least did something to inspire.</p>

<p>In the morning when master Oliver expected
to part for ever with that guinea in his pocket,
he learned the actual state of things and left
no poorer than he came, but all the richer for
the laughter and the merriment and the good
wishes of the friends, who, to divert and amuse
both him and themselves, had treated their
guest so well.</p>

<p>In Trinity College, at the time when Goldsmith
studied there as a sizar, menial offices were
involved in this dubious position. Amongst
these were sweeping the courts in the morning,
carrying up the dishes from the kitchen to the
Fellows' table, waiting for dinner until all the
rest had finished, and wearing a garb to signalise
inferiority and degradation. Common
manliness cannot suffer indignities of this sort.
Johnson at Oxford and Goldsmith in Dublin
rebelled. The agonised sense of decent justice
could not be stifled. In such contexts, only
cowards can wish dishonour borne and indignation
unrevealed. Oliver himself had none of
those conventional prejudices that raise Universities
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
to fetishes. Like the man he was, he
would have been content to enter some true
trade.</p>

<p>His relatives had other thoughts. That
faithful clergyman, his uncle Contarine, persuaded
his nephew into those paths of decorous
ignorance in which the ranks of the respectable
tread their gentle way, and are not rude enough
to question custom. He in his time had been
a sizar, and had not found the duties devolving
lowering or an impediment, as he said, to intimacy
and association with the great and good.
The reason why Goldsmith's career at Dublin
was not radiant was dogging poverty. In the
midst of penury no sooner was money in his
pockets than silver and copper sped in response
to any petition made upon his unfailing if not
unerring charity.</p>

<p>The poor fellow gave the very clothing from
his bed. In the anguish of pity, giving blankets,
and sleeping cold and being laughed at and
scorned, involved the warranty of self-suffering
upon the eager deed. The lad lived in utter
misery through the brutal tyranny of his tutor,
Wilder, a dissolute drunkard, a disgrace to his
own times and incomprehensible to ours. Death
overtook this man in a drunken brawl. His
crimes were not without attenuating circumstances.
College tutors have trials enough to
crush their characters, when they have characters
to crush.</p>

<p>Living in actual need as far as money was
concerned, and a destitution of interest more to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
be pitied, Oliver passed in obscurity through
the University. The Rev. Charles Goldsmith,
dying in 1747, made the position of his son even
more precarious and pathetic, and a career
of mishap and misunderstanding still harder to
endure. We find dear Noll failing in scholarships,
or losing through mere negligence the
prizes he had gained, and, lastly, with a philosophic
indifference to the transitory nature of
mortal learning, pawning the books he ought to
have studied. It was a doleful business. He
had, as he said, "a knack of hoping." It must
have been a clever trick, for it never quite
failed. He wrote ballads that were bought up
eagerly, and merrily sung, cheering the poor
in the common streets of Dublin. He made a
shilling or two now and then upon these transactions.
These, we can imagine, brought him
more pride and pleasure than academic prowess
could have afforded. One night he gave a
supper to his friends, who were all of a lively
and hilarious order, and was for this, before
his assembled guests, thrashed by his tutor for
his breach of college discipline. Selling his
remaining books and his clothes, he fled from
this scene of many sorrows. At Dublin, Goldsmith's
diligence, however faulty, was enough
to gain for him commendation from time to
time, but no distinction worth mentioning.
His worst crime is seen in a riot in which he
was not a ringleader. He scraped into his
scrapes as he scraped through his examinations.</p>

<p>These days were most desolate. His flight
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
was not final. Reconciled to his condition, he
graduated in 1749, his name as usual the last
upon the list. When, later in life, he penned his
<i>Inquiry into the State of Polite Learning</i>, he wrote
from bitter experience. Allied with Johnson
in the feeling of humiliation at the position of a
sizar in a College, Goldsmith went further,
and questioned the whole policy of education
at our schools and Universities. It is hardly
too much to hold him one of the pioneers of
modern methods, and those new, slowly-growing
principles, which mark our present somewhat
broader enlightenment.</p>

<p>Leaving the University, and returning to
his mother's house at Ballymahon, Goldsmith
loafed about lazily, good-humouredly, and
merrily, taking things just as they came. To
bear with him in patience was hard for the
members of his family. Our young, dreaming,
and delightful poet may not have been a blessing
at home. Another hearth saw this minstrel
in his happiest vein. Passing his evenings at
an inn, he gleaned there a knowledge of mankind
of which in later years he made capital use.
In time a finer audience than that he cheered
at this village ale-house, greeted a fairer humour
when this tavern, immortalised in happy
memory, was seen in <i>She Stoops to Conquer</i>. At
this village hostelry, merriment, and not indulgence,
ruled delighted hours. In this haven
of hilarity Oliver sang ditties and told stories
that blessed his boon companions. One recalls
Shenstone's words:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"Whoe'er has travelled life's dull round,<br />
Where'er his stages may have been,<br />
May sigh to think he still has found<br />
The warmest welcome at an inn."<br />
</p></div>

<p>It may seem difficult to discover a hero rejoicing
in comrades discovered in a village ale-house.
Still less should we expect to find in a
heart pleased so easily a man of refined and
exquisite sensibility. Oliver Goldsmith, revelling
in friends coarse and crass to superficial
vision, must have found in them gleams of
holiness that lives less loving could not discern.</p>

<h3>"THE DESERTED VILLAGE"</h3>


<p>The wandering boy, stricken with grief at
the pain and the poverty he sees, alike in
town and village in Ireland, foreshadows and
unveils the coming man, who, knowing his
own anxieties, was ever more distressed by
the cares and afflictions he beheld than by
those through which he was at any time himself
the sufferer.</p>

<p>In all the careers of the essentially great,
there are times when laughter will mingle with
the honour we bestow, and compassion oust
our adoration from its throne. Laughter
may grow derisive and compassion scornful.
Contempt has one virtue&mdash;it recoils. Derision
can find no room within the fathoming comprehension
that does not forget the ceaseless
pressure of those ruthless surroundings in which
often noblest lives are framed.</p>

<p>Pope's line on Gay pictures Goldsmith:</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"In wit, a man&mdash;simplicity, a child."<br />
</p></div>

<p>In these early days no path seemed chosen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
save that of the road following the loitering line
of least resistance.</p>

<p>After his University career was over, Goldsmith
for a while made his home with his
sister and her husband near Lissoy, enjoying
fishing and otter-hunting. Principally he
passed his days idling, as people say, or seeing
visions, as the poets and the prophets plead.
He was often with his brother Henry, sharing
in the pastor's work. Precious these fraternal
communions must have been. Abiding was
Oliver's love for Henry, to the last, deep,
devoted, and revering. During this wayward
era, splendidly attired, and gaily wearing a pair
of red riding-breeches, he called upon the
Bishop, having at the moment a hazy view of
being ordained. Noll's radiant apparel, laughing
eyes, and merry face, made the bewildered
prelate diffident. Contarine procured his nephew
a tutorship, which was held for twelve months,
until one night, playing cards, Noll called his
employer a scoundrel and a cheat. With
thirty pounds in his leaking pockets, later he
set out from home for Cork, and thence, according
to his magnificent plans, for America. He
was not destined to become an Empire-builder
in the Colonies. Six weeks saw him home
again as happy as ever, and quite penniless.
Neither he himself nor anyone else ever knew,
or ever will know now, what in the meantime
had happened to the good fellow. He had
exchanged a capital horse for a lank and bony
creature of which he appeared very fond, called
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Fiddle-back. According to his story, he had
put his kit on board, and the captain of the ship
had sailed without him. No one was too glad
to see him back again so soon. His mother
and his brother Henry knew that neither of
them had means to support him as a man of
fantastic leisure. His indolence dishonoured
the family. Perplexing eccentricities had grown
intolerable. Only old Uncle Contarine stood
by the boy. He still believed in and loved
dear Noll, incorrigible as the good fellow was,
and inexplicable from every vantage. When
he returned poor Oliver had said, with his
happy though here unconscious humour: "And
now, my dear mother, after having struggled
so hard to come home to you, I wonder that
you are not more rejoiced to see me."</p>

<p>Even his poor mother could not welcome
his return with warmth. A certain coldness
crept into the heart of Henry, the beloved
brother. They had been greatly tried. Perhaps
Uncle Contarine continued clement merely
because in the nature of things his responsibilities
for the vagrancies of his kinsman were
inevitably less intimate. As he was not willing
to enter the Church, his uncle now thought
that Goldsmith should go to London and study
law at the Temple. He gave the prodigal
fifty pounds, and bade him God-speed. Goldsmith
made his way as far as Dublin. There,
passing a merry and philanthropic time with
new and old familiars, he gambled away, and
gave away, and lost his money, and all too
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
soon had none for further travels. He returned
with shame upon his brow, completely contrite.
The kindly Contarine possessed that fine
courage, the fortitude of forgiveness. It was
springtime in the poet's heart. This was his
era of heroic hope, immortal dreaming, and
Divine revelation.</p>

<p>Following the traditions of his family, he
would have become a clergyman. It was not
want of religious sentiment that precluded his
feeling sincerely called to this Divine office, but
the unutterable profoundness of his reverence.
With all his laughter he ever had the pure
spirit of the pastor. For the faithful fulfilment
of the ministry, in that marvellous picture of a
parson's life given in <i>The Deserted Village</i> he
has revealed a living and an enlightening ideal.
Here the hearts of priest and poet beat as one.
There is a universal ministry, higher than
divided priesthoods. Oliver Goldsmith, poet,
playwright, and humorist, was a veritable
minister of God. Poetry has one eternal test.
The poem must ever be a very part of the very
life of the poet, his very soul, the breathing hope
and the vital blood of his whole being. This is
true of Goldsmith's two great poems. They
are in themselves a sufficing and beautiful biography.
We know the heart of the man from
these sublime outpourings of the soul. For
every word and every line we love and honour
Goldsmith. <i>The Deserted Village</i> reveals the
singer's sense of sorrow, reverence for the
reverend in life, his compassion and outpouring
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
sympathy, not for single hearts merely, but
that wider love involved and proclaimed in
the understanding pity for a race&mdash;and not
for one place alone, but for a whole land, lain
desolate.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the ultimate verdict upon
Goldsmith's greatest poem, one thing is as
significant as it is certain. These poetic yearnings
were long in his heart ere he gave them
utterance. A wayward, careless lad, heedless
of all responsibility, he seems purposeless and
perplexing to the last degree, yet the profoundest
meditations of his life moved his soul. The
very spell of poetry was upon him. This
Divine revealing may have accounted for that
outward want of earnestness of the character,
and the career that troubled others if it did not
trouble him. The hold upon the inward and
the hidden spirit absorbed and stagnated the
outward movements and the conventional plans
of common existence. It is right to be implicitly
imbued with the honour due to honour,
and that tribute which must in every issue be
humbly paid to elemental guiding and essential
greatness. Amid the inconsequent and eccentric
variations of evolving genius, the Uncle Contarine
possessed inexhaustible patience. If he had
very possibly not a complete confidence in his
wayward nephew, he had an affection for the
lad, and a devotion to his welfare that nothing
could diminish.</p>

<p>This good old man often thought of the
poor widow and her boy. He saw that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
provision for a grown lad, ripening into manhood,
with no visible means of independent
subsistence, and no ostensible desire for any
conceivable occupation, was a burden too
great for the fondest of mothers to bear when
she was very poor. Contarine had been
deeply moved when Oliver came home again
that last time thoroughly ashamed and broken-hearted.
This contrition touched the very
depths of all the old man's sympathy. He must
have been a man of few words&mdash;so few that he
had none to spare for reproaches. He saw to
the full the embarrassments of the situation, and
came once more swiftly to the rescue. His
manner was at all times persuasive rather than
peremptory. His plans were practical and
immediate. Sudden action stayed the possibility
of growing bitterness. Forthwith Goldsmith
was despatched to Edinburgh to qualify
for the medical profession. He was twenty-four
years of age. Although he loved his
family dearly, and cherished the land of his
birth with all its pathos and its poetry, he
never saw Ireland again, nor the kinsmen and
kinswomen to whom, in his heart, he lived his
days mid fault and failure, sorrow and success,
joy and pain, endlessly devoted.</p>

<p>From the earliest days to the last, throughout
the whole career of Oliver Goldsmith, there
were deep emotions in the mind and high
motives in the life and character of this great
man that few in his own times even dimly perceived.
Impenetrable love was hidden in that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
laughter-laden heart, with its outward concealing
and dissimulating vanities.</p>

<p>When the time came, and he might have left
his work in London and gone home to Ireland
for a while, it was too late, for his dear and
gentle mother, old Uncle Contarine, and brother
Henry had passed away. It may be hard to
think that an indolent boy who squanders without
scruple the money you have with great
embarrassment raised for his benefit loves you
devotedly, and has dedicated his whole heart,
and life, and love to yours. It is difficult, too,
to think that a vain little man is, in his soul, an
earnest great one. Yet all this must be achieved
if the heart would know Oliver Goldsmith
rightly, and give at least one faithful life its due.</p>

<p>There is no period in which the moving mind
of genius is not receptive. In those days of
wayward adolescence, Goldsmith found books
somewhere, and many, and read them to the
depths. Some men have left lists of the works
they studied&mdash;even Burns and Byron did.
Noll was never at any time systematic enough
to have done this. Often the spirit is more
influenced by the things that are read and not
greatly heeded, than by those that become the
subject of fixed study. Goldsmith was always
a lover of Latin poetry and classic models. In
this perplexing youthful time of transition, he
had imbued his mind with romance and with
those higher aspirations of the poets of all ages
and eras in which their utterances, growing
religious, pertain to life in its love and light
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
and lofty purity. Literature yields nothing
more enthralling than those passages in which
sublimity is seized, and the mind of man is
commanded to rise above the pressing issue and
the material care.</p>

<p>Prudence has many advantages. It makes
men rich and respectable, but it is the death of
poetry. Prudence has no genius. It cannot
perceive its own deplorable delimitations. It
may not fathom the vagaries of high minds.
Goldsmith was not meant to make his own
fortune. He was intended to make what is far
dearer and better than prosperity&mdash;hope and
happiness for many and many a heart, and
many and many a home. Burns was not prudent,
Byron was not; Johnson was not industrious
for the pure sake and love of labour.
He preferred ease, and never, he acknowledged,
worked when he had a guinea to preclude the
unpleasant necessity of toil. Of Goldsmith
Thackeray said: "The poor fellow was never
so friendless but he could befriend someone."
Sincere and sublime tributes of love, honour,
and affection are offerings doubly blessed,
blessing those who give and those who do
receive. Nobly Oliver Goldsmith revered his
brother Henry. The sudden separation from
this heart was the greatest pain for Goldsmith
when at last the day came.</p>

<p>The best idea of the life of Goldsmith at this
period is gleaned from his great poem <i>The
Deserted Village</i>. These were his words as he
looked back:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"How often have I loitered o'er thy green,<br />
Where humble happiness endeared each scene!"<br />
</p></div>

<p>With what delight he shares the rustic
revelry. There falls the light of lingering love
on each and every line and word:</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"These were thy charms, but all these charms are fled,"<br />
</p></div>

<p>he cries,</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"And desolation saddens all thy green."<br />
</p></div>

<p>He depicts emigration and its devastating
and enforced exile, so widely diverse from the
healthful, free, and willing spirit of true and
liberal colonisation:</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"Far, far away thy children leave the land.<br />
Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey,<br />
Where wealth accumulates, and men decay."<br />
</p></div>

<p>Years later the man wrote these lines, but the
thoughts, the burning sense of burning wrong,
the pain and anguish, were hidden in the heart
of the youth, outwardly so careless:</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"A bold peasantry, their country's pride,<br />
When once destroyed, can never be supplied."<br />
</p></div>

<p>There is a majesty in the lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"His best companions, innocence and health;<br />
And his best riches, ignorance of wealth."<br />
</p></div>

<p>A little later he speaks of</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"Every pang that folly pays to pride."<br />
</p></div>

<p>There is a depth in the man who could write:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"Remembrance wakes with all her busy train,<br />
Swells at my breast, and turns the past to pain;<br />
In all my wanderings round this world of care,<br />
In all my grief&mdash;and God has given my share&mdash;<br />
I still had hopes my latest hours to crown,<br />
Amidst these humble bowers to lay me down."<br />
</p></div>

<p>How pretty and how pathetic is the picture
in this poem of the end that he had fancied for
his days! A thousand and a thousand times
the ceaseless humanity, seeking only love, endears
the man. Mark the sweet, true, and
sublime ideal:</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"Angels around befriending Virtue's friend:<br />
Bends to the grave with unperceived decay,<br />
While resignation gently slopes the way;<br />
And, all his prospects brightening to the last,<br />
His Heaven commences ere the world be past!"<br />
</p></div>

<p>In simplicity Goldsmith equals Gray. There
is a Miltonic dignity truly classical in the
line&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"The sad historian of the pensive plain."<br />
</p></div>

<p>Failures have been indicated in the literary
construction of the finest poems. Critics have
held that Burns, in "The Cotter's Saturday
Night," lost the Scottish and gave the piece an
English colour.</p>

<p>Macaulay contended that the deserted
hamlet pictured by Goldsmith was neither one
thing nor the other, but first Irish and then
English. Criticism purely &aelig;sthetic cannot
destroy the poignancy and profoundness of the
theme and throughout the touch of a master
power.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
From beginning to end the piece proceeds in
a picturesque progress which in its steady
advancement and maintained dignity is splendidly
processional.</p>

<p>At last we come to the village pastor, and
line after line, love leads the light:</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"A man he was to all the country dear,<br />
And passing rich with forty pounds a year;<br />
Remote from towns he ran his godly race,<br />
Nor ere had changed, nor wished to change, his place."<br />
<br />
"Far other aims his heart had learned to prize,<br />
More skilled to raise the wretched than to rise."<br />
<br />
"Pleased with his guests, the good man learned to glow,<br />
And quite forgot their vices in their woe;<br />
Careless their merits or their faults to scan,<br />
His pity gave ere charity began."<br />
<br />
"Truth from his lips prevailed with double sway,<br />
And fools, who came to scoff, remained to pray."<br />
</p></div>

<p>This passage concludes in a fine strain, the
finest in the poem:</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"To them his heart, his love, his griefs, were given,<br />
But all his serious thoughts had rest in Heaven.<br />
As some tall cliff, that lifts its awful form,<br />
Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm,<br />
Though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread,<br />
Eternal sunshine settles on its head."<br />
</p></div>

<p>Here is a transcendent radiance that has
been held the most sublime simile that language
yields. Then, following with a most
delicate transition, we have the genial and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
gentle humour in the picture of the pedagogue
and his pupils, and then the village inn and the
rustics discussing news "much older than their
ale."</p>

<p>Well may the sweetly chiding and chastening
poet reflect,</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"How wide the limits stand,</span><br />
Between a splendid and a happy land."<br />
</p></div>

<p>It may be surprising to hear dear Noll, the
dandy of the Literary Club, deride</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"The glaring impotence of dress."<br />
</p></div>

<p>There is a grace&mdash;nay, more, there is a genius
in transition. The exile and the emigration of
the Irish were not, and are not now, exclusively
territorial, nor is the spiritual pang of leaving
loved homes and cherished hearts entirely
sentimental. Of the Irish it may be said that,
of all the races, their pure love of home is the
deepest, and the most faithful and devoted.
Often the enforced exile that must be endured
had no solace save death and the grave for
peace&mdash;and a home. Of all the fair, and the
gentle and pure, fairest and gentlest and
purest, now and ever, is the Irish girl. Swift the
passage in this tender poem from the village
in its sunshine to the town and the streets in
their darkness, and the clouds about the life of
outcast humanity, suffering a more fearful
exile:</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"Where the poor houseless shivering female lies:<br />
She once, perhaps, in village plenty blest,<br />
Has wept at tales of innocence distrest.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Her modest looks the cottage might adorn,<br />
Sweet as the primrose peeps beneath the thorn;<br />
Now lost to all, her friends, her virtue, fled,<br />
Near her betrayer's door she lays her head."<br />
</p></div>

<p>The wonders of the poem are first its pathos,
and then its picturesqueness and its charm.
With all these glidings from light to grave and
gladness into gloom, and then again to gaiety,
it is a moving and a magic intermingling.
There is a very thunder in the phrase,</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"Pamper luxury, and thin mankind."<br />
</p></div>

<p>And then later:</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"Oh, luxury! thou curst by Heaven's decree,<br />
How ill-exchanged are things like these for thee!<br />
How do thy potions, with insidious joy,<br />
Diffuse their pleasures, only to destroy.<br />
Kingdoms by thee, to sickly greatness grown,<br />
Boast of a florid vigour not their own.<br />
At every draught more large and large they grow,<br />
A bloated mass of rank, unwieldy woe;<br />
Till sapped their strength, and every part unsound,<br />
Down, down they sink, and spread a ruin round."<br />
</p></div>

<p>In this poem we find the sympathy and the
grace of Gray and Wordsworth with a greater
warmth and a glow that is enkindling. The
man who is a master in transition is also and
perforce powerful in contrast. In this graceful
gift the whole piece is a striking study.
Whether the strain be didactic or dramatic,
emotional or vivacious, melody is never lost.
With many poets frequently the whole melodiousness
of poetry disappears in the prose of a
too palpably proclaimed philosophy. This
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
poem from a pure heart, and these lines from a
loving life, enlighten, but do not tease the
mind. There is a prayer in the words,</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"Teach erring man to spurn the rage of gain,<br />
Teach him that states of native strength possest,<br />
Though very poor, may still be very blest."<br />
</p></div>

<p>This poem, and also and not less <i>The Traveller</i>,
although it is a tale of wandering, beyond
all else, reveal the light and the love of the
home.</p>

<h3>"THE TRAVELLER"</h3>


<p>At the University of Edinburgh, Goldsmith
became a more earnest student. He was
certainly not without the higher aspirations of
the sublime profession to which circumstance
and necessity rather than aptitude or inclination
had called him. Whilst it may be questioned
whether he ever had the poetic imagination
of the physician, he never allowed the honour
in which he held the vocation to lessen, and
never lost the satisfaction he himself cherished
through his association with this calling. To
the last he was proud of being&mdash;or as his
cynical critic might say, of counting himself&mdash;a
doctor. In Scotland he worked harder, studied
chemistry with intelligence, and evinced considerable
ability. He viewed with ardour his
prospective work in life, and was keenly interested
in the medical system and the surgical
processes of that period. As a student he was
respected. He became a conspicuous member
of the Medical Society. It is needless, however,
to add that his studies were not so strenuous as
to make his mood at any time monastic, compelling
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
him to live heedless of passing pleasures
and delightful days, or forgetful of his fellow-men.</p>

<p>Goldsmith had been very poor in Dublin. He was not rich in Edinburgh,
but he was welcomed in the refined circles of both University and
civic society. He discovered his place amongst graceful and gracious
women and high-minded and cultured men, and then, all at once, amid
all his new-found success and happiness, he unexpectedly closed his
medical career at the University and left not less suddenly than he
had come. Nothing could be more abrupt than his departure. Rumour has
it that, with chaotic benevolence, he had become security for one of
his fellow-students for a considerable sum of money on account of a
tailor's bill. Here we have the prototype of "the good-natured man."</p>

</div>

<p>Goldsmith could make nothing of mathematics,
and held this science fit only for mean
intellects. Later in his life this delightful
philosopher confided to Malone that he still
held the study in a kind of scorn, seeing that
he could himself turn an ode of Horace into
English better than any of the mathematicians.
There is scarcely an infinitesimal sign of the
principle of mathematical precision about the
career of Oliver Goldsmith. Yet in Scotland,
possibly because the virtue of prudence is infectious,
during this period, for some time and by
some miracle, Noll cultivated a habit to which
he was throughout his career very slightly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
addicted&mdash;he paid his way. Yet when he was
leaving this centre of learning we find Uncle
Contarine once more besought, and this time for
twenty rapidly forthcoming sterling pounds, to
carry Mr. Oliver to the Continent for the completion
of his medical education. The wandering
spirit had seized him. Paris and Leyden, with
their learned lecturers, were but pretexts for
travelling and fulfilling the long-cherished
hope of seeing foreign lands. He thirsted for
deep draughts of experience flowing from the
hidden springs of unknown climes. Professor
Masson wittily tells us that as Goldsmith had
planned to go to Paris, of course he arrived in
the end at Leyden. Having secured those
necessary munitions of war which to the full
extent of his means Uncle Contarine unfailingly
provided, Goldsmith set sail in a ship
bound for Bordeaux. At Newcastle he was,
by mistake, arrested as a political prisoner and
retained in durance as a Jacobite. The ship
sailed without him. It sank; every life was
lost. Soon after reaching Leyden, Goldsmith
left that seat of learning for his wanderings
through Europe, his only aids to this majestic
design being a fine voice and an instrument of
music&mdash;some sort of flute, we must presume. It
was a queer pilgrimage. The peasantry gave
the minstrel food by day and a bed at night.
Village after village welcomed him. He left
Leyden penniless. He might have had a useful
coin or two to help him, but that, espying
some lovely flowers, he could not resist buying
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
all his poor purse permitted and sending them
to Uncle Contarine. No long-suffering uncle,
in all the chronicles and all the untold trials of
uncles, deserved better of a nephew than this
good old man.</p>

<p>Goldsmith's ramble through Europe was one
of the maddest escapades in the records of the
eccentricities of adolescent genius. The enterprise
was attended with ceaseless difficulty,
danger, and deprivation. Not seldom the hedgeside
yielded him his nightly rest. Places of
learning from time to time gave the wanderer a
dinner. He could make the monasteries havens
of repose. For a little while he acted as guide
and tutor to the son of some wealthy manufacturer.
This youth cared nothing for architecture
or antiquity, the histories of cities, or
natural scenery. His sole purpose seemed to
be to save money on his travels. The liberal
and lively tutor left a pupil as dull as he was
mean. The love of wandering lay deep in
Goldsmith's heart. This early pilgrimage
through much of Europe inspired his pen
to write <i>The Traveller</i>. In later years he had
throughout this eager longing for a roving life.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his roaming, in some inexplicable
manner, Goldsmith, the pilgrim of
improvidence and knight errant from the Order
of Chivalrous Carelessness, still pursued his
medical studies, and carried this training for
the vocation of a doctor to some kind of completion.
Italy is supposed to have conferred
his diploma as a physician upon Goldsmith, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
either Padua or Louvain has the honour. <i>The
Traveller</i> must, indeed, long have been in all its
grace and beauty treasured in his heart, for he
actually penned lines for this fine poem during
these boyish wanderings through Europe.</p>

<p>This sojourn on the Continent occupied two
years or more. He reached England in the
year 1756, landing at Dover. This penniless
pilgrim made his way on foot, bravely trudging
the highroad, with few hopes of coming fame,
but many pangs of very present poverty. Our
minstrel gathered a little money here and there
by singing ditties and ballads, spontaneous
compositions, delightfully original, to cheer him
and the laughing rustic hearts he met and loved,
lads and maids, old men and children, and all,
forthwith and henceforth and for ever, his
friends. Tramping from Dover, receiving a
warm English welcome at many a wayside
farm, and the hearty hospitality of the cottage
hearth and home; anon sleeping in barns, or,
if need be, making the hedgerow his haven and
shelter for the night, passing village after
village&mdash;the days went by, and then he sighted
the great town of great trial. He entered
London, the city of cities, with its innumerable
multitudes and its untold loneliness.</p>

<p>No one can read the opening line in <i>The
Traveller</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"Remote, unfriended, melancholy, slow"&mdash;<br />
</p></div>

<p>without feeling that the words could only
have sprung from very genius. We have here
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
that uniqueness that signalises and divides.
Throughout there is that sincerity of sentiment
which separates and guides those deeper
natures who amid all joys know the vein of
sorrow prevailing in the human heart. From
yearning aspiration comes that exaltation which
connotes the higher character. It is this
element that we are apt to forget in our
humorists. Lamb, Hood, Thackeray, and
Goldsmith, had strains of reflection which
went more into the very heart of being and
not being, fulfilling and failing, living and
dying, than we can ever discover in those who
decorate their days with a clamant seriousness.
That semblance of earnestness accepted by the
populace often lacks poetic force and sublime
sanction. <i>The Traveller</i> attains the heights and
depths of the Divine communion that unites
poetry with prayer. The speeding pen, the
quivering lips, the moving mind, and beating
heart, are slight contrasted with this prayerful
yearning of the unseen and spiritual. Poetry
is the unutterable, yet sweetly and strangely
uttered voicing of the soul ineffable.</p>

<p><i>She Stoops to Conquer</i> inspired Sheridan
with his inimitable dramatic conceptions. <i>The
Traveller</i> roused Byron to the heights he
attained in "Childe Harold's Pilgrimage." <i>The
Traveller</i> heralds an era and proclaims the true
imperial note, clear and triumphant. If poetry
be the prophetic vein, calling an age to realise its
aspirations, foreseeing, forewarning, and foremaking
coming time, then here the poet, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
maker, and the creator, speaks. Nor kings
nor warriors rule, but thinkers, and amongst
these rulers in the high realm of thought and
spiritual power, highest of all in every age
and clime&mdash;the poet! Hidden in the soul's
depths we discover an earnestness which in the
outward light-hearted man we fail to recognise.
That one we thought we knew so well, we
find, too late, we knew, if not altogether ill,
at least too slightingly. The poem is doubtless
too didactic at times to always move
consummate delight. There is a ring more
Latin than English in the line,</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"Wealth, commerce, honour, liberty, content."<br />
</p></div>

<p>Yet even in this we see how words can weigh
with meaning, and not one prove wasted, but
each contributes to the fulfilling of the complete
intention. This line has that poetic
power which in one single flash can show what
volumes men might write and not reveal. Pope
crippled meaning and weakened force to procure
a rhyme&mdash;nay, since he actually planned the
rhymes to make his couplets before he penned
his poetry, to him not infrequently it was far
more to rhyme than realise. In Goldsmith's
couplet,</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"Till carried to excess in each domain,<br />
This favourite good begets peculiar pain,"<br />
</p></div>

<p>we have a dissertation upon both individual
and national ethics, and the sole secret of the
failures of men and States. There appear
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
passages where Goldsmith held Virgil much in
view. To some extent this poem, and also
<i>The Deserted Village</i>, remind one of Volney.
In this light the style in places is more French
than English. There is full force in the
phrase,</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"And e'en in penance, planning sins anew."<br />
</p></div>

<p>While the poem is always graceful, readers are
not at their happiest when pleasing poets turn
philosophers. Throughout the piece there is a
manly courage, a purity of motive, a magnanimous
ideality, and an unexpected and almost
muscular robustness. What gaiety there is in
this phrase&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"Sport and flutter in a kinder sky."<br />
</p></div>

<p>We have, when he comes to France, upon
which country he writes delightfully, a couplet
happily autobiographical:</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"Yet would the village praise my wondrous power,<br />
And dance forgetful of the noontide hour."<br />
</p></div>

<p>Radiant must have been the moments when
later the little man in Fleet Street could look
back on scenes like these. We wish that his
own graceful pen had granted us a full and
vivid record of his roamings.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that from the higher standpoint
Goldsmith owed much to Dublin, Edinburgh,
Leyden, or Louvain. His class-rooms
for the study of life were provided in rustic
inns, his studious chambers village greens in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
the land where he was born, French riversides,
Swiss mountains, Italian lakes, the blue skies
of many climes, and later the crowded streets
of the London he loved. His books were the
hearts of women, the smiles of children, and
the lives of men.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>LONDON</h3>


<p>Young Oliver Goldsmith, diffident and with no adroitness of address,
was not one of those authors who can take publishers by storm, and
fame with a wave of the hand. He was a nervous man. Although one of
the most collected of writers, he had to be fully at his ease before,
in conversation or the common intercourse of society, he could be
himself and reveal that force of mind and invincibility of personality
that mark his influence and creates his charm. He knew and felt his
weakness. When Johnson narrated his adventures in a close and friendly
gossip with the King, Goldsmith said:</p>

<p>"Well, you acquitted yourself in this conversation
better than I should have done, for
I should have bowed and stammered through
the whole of it."</p>

<p>Goldsmith's face must have shone in moments
of animation, its very ugliness gaining a beauty
all its own, more lovable for that transformation
one smile creates. He may have had an
uncouth appearance and an awkward bearing.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
The charm and gentleness of such a spirit as
his must have outweighed accidents of form.
Now we associate an inevitable purity and
tenderness with him and with all he ever
did. If he had a poor outward mien and
fashion, men must have thought nothing
of this compared to the inward grace of the
heart and love-illumined soul of the man.</p>

<p>Alone in London, he had come to his fierce
fight: not for fame, but for bread. Through all
his squalid wanderings in the hard times, and
all his sordid trials, he sustained his cheerfulness,
and in a selfless supremacy ever strove
to bestow on other lives the faith and courage
his own bright heart never wholly lost. How
he lived in these early days in London no one
knows, and the tale of want, care, and humiliation
incident to gnawing peril and privation
made a story too agonising for him, open as he
was, ever to fully reveal. He said one day
very quietly: "When I lived among the
beggars in Axe Lane."</p>

<p>He may have laughed as he said the words.
He must have shuddered. The laugh was a
selfless sacrifice. The shudder was real and
to the very last too true, for painful memory
was vivid. We cannot tell whether, like Shakespeare,
he held the reins of horses, standing
outside taverns and theatres; or whether he
carried bags for pence, ran errands, gambled
for his bread, or begged for shelter. Here was a
sweet, weak, pure, and gentle, sympathetic lad,
only a boy in heart and strength, and not even
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
a child in that hardness life demands, stepping
he knew not whither, meeting the world in an
actual and visible solitude, and a loneliness of
soul beyond the force of words to tell. There
are those who, having passed their twentieth
year, are already men of mark and power.
Not such a one was poor Noll. Through
ceaseless dependence and uncertainty in both
his purpose and his position in life, he tardily
gained that dignity and validity that attends the
realisation of man's estate.</p>

<p>With Goldsmith now one eager and despairing
quest for work followed hard upon another,
and disappointments in rapid and relentless
succession. After wandering on from door to
door, and hope to its scattering, and chance to
its dispelling, he obtained his first situation as
a dispenser in a chemist's shop. He lost opportunities
and failed to create confidence, more
than anything through the forlornness of his
appearance, and the too obvious simplicity of
his bearing. Then he heard of an old friend,
a warm-hearted Edinburgh student, a certain
Dr. Sleigh. To this generous man he bent his
steps. As soon as he was recognized, he was
received into the home of his former companion,
and welcomed with all that brotherliness of
which sterling friendship is capable.</p>

<p>The old apothecary, with whom Goldsmith
worked as a dispenser for a time, deserves the
grateful honour that we now can pay his kindly
heart. His name was Jacobs. He appears to
have been an old man of benign mien and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
inclination. He recognized the superior learning
and credentials of his young assistant. He
thought that a qualified doctor should not be
serving drugs in a shop, but in greater dignity
visiting his patients. Largely through this
man's kindly exertions, and also with a little
help from Dr. Sleigh, who soon left London and
was lost to his former friend, and with the
sympathy and good wishes of more than one old
Edinburgh comrade, remembered and met again,
Goldsmith was set up in a mean and meagre
manner as a physician, in a very poor and
dingy neighbourhood&mdash;Bank Side, Southwark.
The whole prospect was neither pleasant nor
propitious. Hidden in his desolute obscurity,
friends lost, for a time at all events, all thought
of Goldsmith. The poor doctor soon seemed
quite alone, and, what was worse, forgotten.</p>

<p>From the moment that Oliver Goldsmith
entered London, penury and meanness had
dogged his steps. It is piteous to dwell upon
these squalid scenes. We need not recall the
second-hand wardrobe that decked him out as
a physician in this practice, unimaginably poor
and dark and dingy. Fancy cannot conceive a
greater dreariness or deeper destitution. He
was so poor that his poorest patients felt compassion
for his even greater poverty. Seeing
one day his doctor's pockets bulging with
papers, so that he looked like the man of letters
in a then clever and popular caricature, an
invalid, a journeyman printer, who had sought
this physician's aid and advice, now feelingly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
commended him to Samuel Richardson, his
own master and employer, with at first, at all
events, apparently auspicious results. Leaving
his dubious practice, Goldsmith became proof
reader to the printer, publisher, and novelist
who had also in his own good time befriended
the great Dr. Johnson. No ultimate advantage,
however, accrued to Goldsmith from this distinguished
association with and employment by
one of the most successful authors of the day.</p>

<p>He met the poet Young, and other men. He
never wrote for Richardson, and soon left this
place of books and business. His position can
have been neither dignified nor lucrative. The
wanderer bent his weary feet, neither knowing
whither his steps might tend nor with the
wherewithal to meet the journey. He was
almost starving in the streets, when one day he
met young Milner, another Edinburgh student,
who carried Noll off to his father, a learned
Presbyterian divine, who kept a school. Goldsmith
then had, it seems, some vague dream
about being sent to the East to decipher
ancient inscriptions, but in the end he found
occupation in Peckham, and not Palestine.</p>

<p>There is no particular reason, however wayward
his studies, to question that Goldsmith
was, in the lighter order of that day, a qualified
physician. When he landed in England from
the Continent in all probability he had secreted
in some loose pocket a foreign medical diploma.
Besides this certificate, granting him the right
to practise, but not the power to succeed, as a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
doctor, he carried other papers&mdash;parts of poems,
essays, notes for plays, and perhaps even then
the opening of a novel. He set great store on
these precious papers. He may have lost his
diploma. He became an usher in Dr. Milner's
school at Peckham. He hated this work. In
<i>The Vicar of Wakefield</i>, in a few striking sentences,
he shows the humiliations of the position.
Wherever we find him, he is always the same
in the matter of worldly prudence, and in his
fondness for making those about him bright.
He spent his salary in giving treats to his
pupils. The kindly schoolmaster's wife said
that she ought to keep Mr. Goldsmith's money
as well as the young gentlemen's. Dear Noll
was full of fun and fine humour for the boys
about him, doing all he could for their delight,
and loving some like a brother. When years
had passed and he had attained his fame, he
met one of his old scholars, knew him in an
instant, and although the lad had become a
married man, was anxious, as in the old days,
to treat him at an apple-stall. Then suddenly
he said:</p>

<p>"Sam, have you seen my picture by Sir
Joshua Reynolds? Have you seen it, Sam?
Have you got an engraving?"</p>

<p>Sam had not yet procured the picture.</p>

<p>"Sam," said Goldsmith, "if your picture
had been published, I should not have waited
an hour without having it."</p>

<p>Despite his pranks with his pupils, this time
was no happy period. The unpleasantness of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
the office and the severities of the scorned and
profitless labours weighed sorely on him.
Every collection of schoolboys has its share of
ineffaceable snobs. These were a trial to the
teacher. Amid his practical jokes with William
the footboy, and one merry-maker and another,
there is still an underlying earnestness in all
and a reverence for the pure sentiment of the
heart. At this time, when asked whom he held
the best commentator on the Scriptures, Goldsmith
replied very simply, "Common Sense."</p>

<p>The principal of the school, Dr. Milner, was
one of the most sincere of Goldsmith's friends.
At the house of this good man, Griffiths, the
publisher, meeting Goldsmith, detected his
abilities at once, and found him the first opening
for his literary labours. He gave him mere
hack-work on the <i>Monthly Review</i>. This was
the Whig journal of the day, and opposed later
by its Tory rival, the <i>Critical Review</i>, edited by
Smollet, also physician, novelist, and historian.
Leaving Peckham, Goldsmith now lived for a
while over the shop of his employer in Paternoster
Row, gaining shelter of a sort and board
and lodging.</p>

<p>Poor as may have been the fare, and mean
as must have been the livelihood under the
roof of Mr. and Mrs. Griffiths, Oliver Goldsmith,
escaping from these conditions of life,
entered others that were for a time, at all
events, far worse. One cannot tell what he
did, or where he went, or how he lived. Near
Salisbury Square some squalid garret sheltered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
him. He tried to shun the common gaze and
hide his very whereabouts. He turned to
translating, chance criticisms, and any drudgery
that came his way, and all to little purpose.
He lived in wretchedness and obscurity, bearing
the weight of an increasing poverty, until
at last the very hope of bare subsistence perished.</p>

<p>On one dark and misty day, as Goldsmith,
in his tattered and threadbare clothes, sat
pensive and dejected in his dingy, miserable
garret, rich in fancies and very poor in food,
a merry rap upon the door aroused the poet
from his meditations. A young countryman,
all hope and health, had briskly announced his
advent. This comer was not one to wait without
and need a bidding for his entrance. Oliver
could not hide himself completely. He was
tracked down at last, and by none other than
his younger brother Charles. To the youth
the emaciated apparition of poor Oliver was
indeed astounding. Charles had pictured him
already a prosperous and influential man of
letters, who had but to raise and wave his hand
to confer work, wealth, and position, and the
possibilities of fame upon anyone whom he
might lovingly patronise and befriend. Imagine
the disappointment.</p>

<p>"All in good time, my dear boy," said Oliver.
"I shall be richer by-and-by. Besides, you
see, I am not in positive want. Addison, let
me tell you, wrote his poem of 'The Campaign'
in a garret in the Haymarket, three
storeys high, and you see I am not come to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
that yet, for I have only reached the second
storey."</p>

<p>Some days later, just as suddenly as he had
come, the younger brother vanished. He had
brought Oliver a breath of the old home.
Charles made his way to Jamaica, in all likelihood
as a common sailor, and proved a rover
to the last. Darker shadows were to fall upon
poor Noll through still deeper experience of
deprivation, misadventure and despair. The
days of doubt were passed at last, and in the
end successes were achieved in every sphere,
unrivalled alike in their sublime heights and
vast variety.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>"THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD"</h3>


<p>Goldsmith's first victory was the <i>Inquiry
into the State of Polite Learning</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Inquiry</i> was written at a time when its
author had suffered from the tyranny and the
mercilessness of booksellers. This explains his
onslaught upon this then ungenerous craft.
Injury had been heaped on insult. Disappointment
and despair were tearing and gnawing at
the poor man's heart. The demon imp of petty
poverty first starved him and then laughed at
his insufficing fare, reduced him to rags and
ridiculed his wretchedness.</p>

<p>The <i>Inquiry</i> was published by Dodsley. Upon
this work the poor author placed all his hopes,
and was not disappointed. He had sailed his
little boat to the sea at last. The hardships,
however, that he had passed through held to
the end their sway upon his heart.</p>

<p>The <i>Inquiry</i> was for its author the first
triumphant advance. Its consequences had
their obverse aspect. The criticism of actor-managers
drew forth Garrick's indignation.
The results of this were to be realised later in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Goldsmith's career. The judicial severities
levelled against the tribe of publishers gathered
black clouds. Griffiths took the onslaught on
his craft as personal, and thundered out a
libellous retort, that, wanting much, was lacking
nothing in spite, which failing in taste
found its fruition in malice. Griffiths was one
of those mean men who can never forgive, and
whose deeds in sober truth do test the force of
our own capacity to pardon and forget. Even
when Goldsmith was dead, Griffiths still tried
to cast vituperations on the poor man's memory.</p>

</div>

<p>At this time Noll engaged to furnish two
brightly written articles each week for the
<i>Public Ledger</i>, of which paper Newbery was
the proprietor. These serial articles appeared
under the title of <i>The Citizen of the World</i>. A
large concourse of readers looked forward to
the welcome advents of the cheerful and clever
Citizen. The character became a household
word. This was Goldsmith's first really great
popular hit. Apart, however, from the appreciation
of the general public, it must be considered
that, more than anything hitherto, these
articles brought their author to the knowledge
and gained the admiration of the men of letters
of his day. The <i>Citizen</i> figures in a popular
and lively light, yet still with a charming and
a moving manner. Here we see the writer in
his fairest freedom and delight, ruling a little
philosophic realm and social world all his own.
Up to that time nothing quite like it had been
done before. There is, as the name implies,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
a world of difference between Addison, the
Spectator; Steele, the Tatler; Johnson, the
Rambler; and Goldsmith, the Citizen.</p>

<p><i>The Citizen of the World</i> is a capital collection
of essays, possessed of an imperishable interest
and significance, and a charm as faultless and
unfailing as that compassion and consuming
charity which never pass from the page, and
never deserted the heart of their gentle author.
Still, this spirit touches and moves the heart.
He saw the wrongs and the goodness, the truth
and the untruth, and he knew the minds of men.
This cosmopolitan saw Russia, the enemy of
the peace of Europe, and foresaw its vast
advancing, aggressive power. He warned the
English how insecure was their then faulty
hold upon the American colonies. In these
essays we find vigorous and thrilling protests
against cruelty to animals. These appeals then
were rare indeed, and even now are only revealed
in any earnestness through a slowly
dawning purer spirit. The greatest men of
that age, and the best, loved Goldsmith like a
brother. Very soon we see Dr. Johnson
marching down Fleet Street arm-in-arm with
Percy to take supper with Dr. Goldsmith.
The lexicographer has on a new suit of
clothes and a wig finely powdered, and looks
uncommon through this unexpected scrupulosity
of costume. Percy is impertinent enough
to inquire the cause of this finery.</p>

<p>"Why, sir," said Johnson, "I hear that
Goldsmith, who is a very great sloven, justifies
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
his disregard of cleanliness and decency by
quoting my practice, and I am desirous this
night to show him a better example."</p>

<p>This amusing incident marks the foundation
of a great friendship. If ever Goldsmith had a
friend, that friend was Johnson; if Johnson ever
had a friend, that friend was Goldsmith. The
story does not proclaim dear Noll a dandy this
time. Doubtless his care or carelessness in
garment kept pace, step by step, with varying
moods. There is evidence enough to tell us
how much he doted on finery and fashionable
raiment in those bills from his tailor, which to
the very last remained unpaid. Filby could
afford the loss. It will be gathered from all
this that with a change in fortune there had
also been a departure from those scanty quarters
in Green Arbour Court. His new apartments
in Wine Office Court, Fleet Street, were not
elaborately furnished, nor dignified in themselves
or their situation, but they were the sign
of better days. For all Fame brings its rich
rewards. For Goldsmith the greatest of these
was Johnson's friendship and esteem. The
bond that bound these two was this, that they
were always the last to abandon the poor and
the worthless. Tired out with failure or importunity,
other men of kindly heart might leave
the incorrigible to their fate, but not Samuel
Johnson nor Oliver Goldsmith. A better basis
for friendship could not be.</p>

<p>No sooner was Goldsmith known, than a
bright devoted band of loving spirits clustered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
round, loving the life of the man and feeling
the help and the hope that it gave. Simplicity
sways its sceptre. Purity of heart is a Divine
power. Not through his position and achievements,
but for himself, men and women loved
and honoured him. Burke and Reynolds
became his devoted friends and constant allies.
Fairest of all the bonds was that dreamy
sympathy with the sweet little Jessamy Bride.
He loved the poor. In this affection it might
be said that his very life was dedicated to all
who bore the burden of sad necessity, and
needed help or solace in their suffering. For
the most part his intimacies were with men, but
noble women whose names have passed away
must have honoured him and found that hour
a happy one that brought the comforting and
kindly and enkindling soul within the circle of
the home. He loved children and understood
them. He longed to have them for his readers.
In a picturesque succession the old lady who

<h3>THE LITERARY CLUB</h3>


<p>Goldsmith's income accrued, not
through royalties upon his few great and
immortal works, but from arduous and endless
ephemeral tasks. This ceaseless taxation of
the mental faculties probably represents the
most exhausting of all the processes of gaining
a decent livelihood. Never the strongest of
men, these relentless intellectual exactions gave
the brain no rest, and kept the physical frame
in a condition of constant nervous weakness.
Writing from a bed of sickness, he tells his
employer almost pitifully, amid the strain of
things, that he cannot complete his translations
from Plutarch. Without a pension or a sinecure
in some office of the State, literary life at that
time was fraught with such incalculable difficulties
that it demanded the maximum of prudence
to achieve the minimum of subsistence. Men
of letters lived, and by some miracle enjoyed
themselves. The commercial basis of their
being, and their professional and economic
relationship with both the booksellers and the
public, were as unsatisfactory as can be imagined.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
The sum received by Milton for "Paradise
Lost" indicates the usage of an earlier day.
Things had not much improved. Newbery
gave five guineas for the copyright of <i>The
Citizen of the World</i> and fourteen guineas for
<i>The Life of Beau Nash</i>. A struggle consequent
upon the combination of very little means,
and still less practical prudence, soon began in
Goldsmith's case. His mode of life, if not
luxurious, was easier than it had been. It
bore the semblance of secure prosperity. He
left his chambers in Wine Office Court for a
more commodious set of apartments in Canonbury,
then a delightful village. Newbery made
all the arrangements. From him Goldsmith's
landlady received her quarterly due for the
board and lodging of this celebrated author.
However precautious this plan of payment may
have been, it probably led to Noll spending
more on incidental outlays than he otherwise
would have done with a weekly reckoning to
meet. His cares never came from personal
profusion or self-indulgence, but from the
warmth and impulse of his too generous heart
and lavish love of giving. With him the purpose
of money was not its preservation for
a rainy day, but its distribution on a fine one.
He never found much fun in making guineas
come, or hilarity in keeping them. It was a
vast delight to make them fly. At this feat no
one was ever more accomplished. Here we
have the man and his mistakes, and the troubles
that came, and came to stay. Some might
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
have grown rich from his financial opportunities.
Whilst making the most and the worst of his
prudential incompetence, it is easy to estimate
too highly his rewards. It is an exaggeration
to speak of his having made in his time thousands
of pounds.</p>

<p>All he earned very hardly he squandered
most carelessly. This foreshadows that fierce
stream of fatality in which he proved powerless
to the end. Underlying currents of embarrassments
were as constant as the grace and purity
and beauty of his heart, and more close to him
than that they could not be. Those men of
business who never had their dues met, were
better able to bear the losses than would have
been the poor pensioners whom Goldsmith's
compassion enriched. His was never the
philanthropy of reasoned prudence, but that of
impotent prodigality. He scattered guineas
as heedless of himself as he was careless of his
creditors. He was at this time most industrious.
In 1763 and 1764 he produced countless miscellaneous
articles and essays. He composed a
<i>History of England</i> in a series of letters written
after the manner of a nobleman to his son,
and through this mistakenly attributed to
Lord Chesterfield. He may have penned
"Goody Two-Shoes"&mdash;it is too late to tell.
Subsequently came another and more responsible
<i>History of England</i>, used until recently in
many of our public schools. Oliver Goldsmith
had become one of the men of his time.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more interesting in every
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
period in the history of literature, art, science,
and philosophy than the manner in which,
thrown together by the mysterious magnetism
of mutually alluring greatness and power, the
first and highest minds of all epochs grow
inevitably associated. We find this now in the
formation of the Literary Club, of which many
of the most moving minds of that day in
which Goldsmith lived were members. The
Club met on Monday evenings in the Turk's
Head Tavern, Soho. It was in working
order in 1764. Sir Joshua Reynolds was its
founder. Goldsmith's membership of the
Literary Club, happy as it was, marks great
misunderstandings involved in that misguided
judgment passed upon the man by his contemporaries,
which posterity has been content too
easily to accept. It was thought that Oliver
Goldsmith had no learning to substantiate his
position, and that he had no wit for conversation,
but only for writing. There is so little to
support these ideas that it is surprising that
they should have arisen, and for any period, or
in any mind, have persisted. Horace Walpole,
in his graceful way, called Goldsmith an inspired
idiot. Garrick told us that "Dear Noll wrote
like an angel and talked like poor Poll." Johnson
said: "No man was more foolish when he
had not a pen in his hand." The charge that
Goldsmith was incapable of collected thought
in conversation falls to the ground if we recall
one gentle utterance: "It must be much from
you, sir, that I take ill." These words from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
one who had suffered an indescribably teasing
impertinence at the hands of Johnson are the
most collected conceivable. They are not less
chivalrous. In <i>The Retaliation</i> Johnson alone
is spared. To this friend nothing could shake
Goldsmith's admiring and unalterable faithfulness
and affection. There is a certain spirit in
expression that must stand inevitably associated
with the collected mind. When it was wondered
why Johnson cared for some unhappy mortal
who had no charm or talent, Goldsmith said,
in his quiet and reflective way: "The man is
poor and honest, which is recommendation
enough for Johnson." Concerning one who
was undeserving, according to the manner of
the world, who had no honour, and had forfeited
all claim to character, yet still retained Johnson's
compassion, Goldsmith rejoined: "This man
has become miserable, and that ensures the
protection of Johnson." Goldsmith, who could
so readily reply to protests with answers at
once as felicitous and as reflective as these,
could not have been an uncollected conversationalist.
Not merely the words, but also the
manner that one must associate with their
utterance preclude the possibility. Goldsmith
is supposed to have had no learning because
one day he called upon Gibbon, who gulled
him. He questioned the author of "The
Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire" upon
some historic issue, and the historian led him
grotesquely astray. Who would not have
accepted anything Gibbon said without criticism?
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
Who would have expected this great
personage capable of indulging in a school-boy
prank? Goldsmith's writings prove him well
instructed and widely read, and show his mind
as curiously stored and equipped as its whole
genius was charming and gracious. If he
could not talk, but could only write, then the
pen in his hand is taken as an instrument
capable of exerting hypnotic force, and converting
by magic a fool into a wit.</p>

<p>In his own time, from some unaccountable
cause, it became a habit to treat Goldsmith
with a form of moral and intellectual patronage.
This has never entirely passed away.
Carlyle, following Horace Walpole's idea,
writing of Johnson, thus speaks of Goldsmith:
"An inspired idiot hangs strangely about him.
Yet on the whole there is no evil in the gooseberry
fool, but rather much good&mdash;of a fine, if
of a weaker sort than Johnson's&mdash;and all the
more genuine that he himself could never
become conscious of it."</p>

<p>In the sphere of the high-minded of that
period, with the possible but not the clear and
certain exception of Johnson himself, not one
in all that circle, illustrious as it was, so impressed
the kindred spirits of that time and age
as Oliver Goldsmith did. His impressiveness
swayed its force and influence over all. This
was due first to the winning grace, but
partly to the greatness of the man. "Dr.
Goldsmith," said Johnson, "is one of the first
men we now have as an author, and he is a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
very worthy man, too." At another time he
said: "As a writer he was of the most distinguished
abilities. Whatever he composed
he did it better than any other man could, and
whether we consider him as a poet, as a comic
writer, or as a historian, so far as regards his
power of composition he was one of the finest
writers of his time, and will ever stand in the
foremost class." These words were uttered
shortly after Goldsmith's death. One can
imagine the looking back with love upon the
companionship and the conversation of one
friend at least who would never be forgotten.
All natures in some sphere, touch the infinite.
In the silence of his great heart, the radiance of
his intellect, and in his uttered word, the very
soul of Goldsmith's genius lies in a loving
understanding. In this man there flows and
shines the very grace of the very Christ. Unfailing
gentleness lives lighted by divinity.</p>

</div>

<p>Those were happy days passed in heart-to-heart
friendships and affections, and they were
merry hours that sped so swiftly at the Literary
Club. The great are never greater than in
the hearts of their homes and the simplicities
of their friendships. At this club the gods
forgot their power and high beings laid aside
their loftiness. In the midst we find the man
they teased the man most welcome; that one
that all affected to despise, each in his inmost
heart unfeignedly respected. The man most
laughed at was most loved. Oliver Goldsmith
made the mirth of things. He was always forbearing,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
and to this passive pleasingness he
added that finest of activities, unfailing kindliness.
If it is no wonder that they loved him,
it is no marvel that they laughed at him as
well.</p>

<p>It is commonly said that Goldsmith had a
thick-set figure. This does not mean that he
was a sturdy, muscular man. Weakness of
constitution, a habit of stooping as he strolled
in his meditative manner, and constantly bending
as he wrote at desk or table, and early
deprivations both of soul and body, had huddled
up the low stature and given the compressed
frame a semblance of solidity. His cheeks
were sunken, and there were dark rims about
the eyes, and the minimum of fleshly and substantial
covering clad these limbs. Goldsmith
had a queer little manner of bobbing. This
bob he fondly imagined a bow. That it was
meant to be dignified there is no doubt. It
came a little from that personal vanity from
which no one will ever wish to deem him
entirely exempt, and a little, too, from great
nervousness. It flowed also from an innate
good breeding and cultured and natural
chivalry. This bobbing as he entered or left
a room was finely caricatured by Garrick. No
doubt the actor's own bowing was the perfection
of formal grace. Yet if the motive of
politeness and personal ceremonial condone
its outward and practical shortcomings, then
we shall discover more true soul in Goldsmith's
bob than Garrick's bow. Noll bobbed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
timidly when compliments were paid him, and
gratefully and affirmatively when in his
presence he heard others praised. If anything
noble or beautiful was told of anyone, then
came the revering little bob, this time intended
as a tribute to human honour and the virtue of
the heart and the valour of the race.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>DEBTS AND DIGNITIES</h3>


<p>All through his life Goldsmith was greatly
given to grand clothes. It is a pity that
grand clothes were not always greatly given to
him, for he never appeared quite able to pay
for them. Although he became deeply involved
in debt, he never cultivated luxurious or unworthy
delights. His pleasures were of the
simplest. His insolvent condition was due, true
enough, to pleasure and his foremost luxury&mdash;the
luxury of ceaseless charities that he could
as ill afford as a coach-and-four. He was one
of the hearts not meant to draw near the
gates of heaven alone, and could not accept a
pleasure without someone sharing it with him
and having more than half.</p>

<p>When he gave his suppers, we find the measure
of the man who always gave more than
he received, for the viands were for his friends,
and a basin of boiled milk satisfied his own
demands. There is a sad message in the milk.
It showed the concealed weakness of the little
man, and the growing disease, not now ever to
be wholly known, from which he died so young.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
Too likely all through his life some constant,
growing pain, stealing his pleasures, stole his
prudence too. He was always frank and as open
with his creditors, as he was candid with his
friends. When Newbery's account with him
had become complicated, he had no means of
liquidating the reckoning save by offering the
copyright of his play, then advancing towards
production under many disadvantages.</p>

<p>"To tell the truth, Frank," he said, in his
lofty and affable manner, "there are very small
hopes of its success."</p>

<p>It is almost diverting to find Goldsmith himself
baffled, if not beaten, in seeking prosperity
from literature, majestically introducing others
into the sacred sphere. His name was sufficient
to lead others to those rewards that he
himself needed even more than they did. Like
Johnson, Goldsmith wrote many introductions
to books and various dedications for authors,
who availed themselves both of the influence
and of the ability of these distinguished leaders
in the realm of letters. When Goldsmith had
become known in the world and life of literature,
and was already respected by a select
circle of the authors of the time, although his
place and power were by no means established,
it was through the pressure of debt and its distresses
that the greatest work of his genius
came to light.</p>

<p>"One morning in the year 1764," said Dr.
Johnson to the faithful Boswell, "I received a
message from poor Goldsmith that he was in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
great distress, and as it was not in his power to
come to me, begging that I would come to him
as soon as possible. I sent him a guinea, and
promised to come to him directly. I accordingly
went as soon as I was dressed."</p>

<p>It is impossible to pass and not pause
here in grateful admiration for the true heart of
Dr. Johnson, who never failed a friend or any
man. He proceeded with his confidences.</p>

<p>"I found," he went on, concerning Goldsmith,
"that his landlady had arrested him for
his rent, at which he was in a violent passion.
I perceived that he had already changed my
guinea and had got a bottle of Madeira and a
glass before him."</p>

<p>The coming passage is beautifully characteristic:</p>

<p>"I put the cork into the bottle," said Johnson,
and then goes on with the narrative.</p>

<p>"I desired he would be calm," he proceeded,
"and I began to talk to him of the means by
which he might be extricated. He then told
me that he had a novel ready for the press,
which he produced. I looked into it and saw
its merits, told the landlady I should soon
return, and having gone to a bookseller, sold it
for sixty pounds. I brought Goldsmith the
money, and he discharged his rent, not without
rating his landlady in high tone for having
used him so ill."</p>

<p>Amid all his distresses, Goldsmith had been
quietly and diligently perfecting his beautiful
novel, <i>The Vicar of Wakefield</i>. Simultaneously
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
he had been engaged upon <i>The Traveller</i>. At
that very instant it lay completed in his desk.</p>

<p>The pure delights of life he knew faithfully, and lovingly bestowed.
This man possessed not merely in an unusual, but in an absolutely
unique, degree the grace of sympathetic affectionateness. He fulfilled
the Pauline mandate, "Be kindly affectionate one to another." In
Goldsmith this was nothing less than very genius. His graceful letters
to his Irish friends, and, indeed, to all to whom he ever wrote,
evince the kindest and most caressing feelings imaginable. They are
about the home, the children, the pet animals, and trivial ties, and
pleasing, pleading memories and hopes. As you read, Divinity hedges
about the lowly hearths that he pictured so lovingly. It is a curious
power. When Goldsmith was at Bath, from the way that Johnson mentions
him in his letters to Langton we note how much the little doctor was
missed by his friend when he left town. It was a bright moment when
Goldsmith moved into his chambers in the Temple. Here he lived his
last years, and his literary life will always be associated more with
this place than with any other. In these rooms, amongst his friends
might have been seen old General Oglethorpe, that courageous veteran
Paoli, and the young and dauntless Grattan. Here the <i>Roman History</i>
was written. This work was greatly applauded by the critics. Its
production made Johnson burst forth into that splendour of laudation
in which he said that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
whatever Goldsmith did, he did better than all others, and he counted
him as an historian superior to Hume, Smollett, and Lyttelton.
Goldsmith had a fine faculty in histories for presenting vital facts
concisely, and making his pages compendious. The grace he had by
instinct others strove to create by vast elaboration. It has been said
that Robertson's ornamentations hid what is essential in his records.
No one can ever discover Goldsmith in anything striving for effect. It
is not possible now to enumerate, or even ascertain, all the friends
that came to those chambers in the Temple. Among them may be mentioned
young Craddock, with an estate in the country, &aelig;sthetic
tendencies, and literary talents. With him, in a few light musical
works that came to little, Goldsmith collaborated. This man had that
respect for the poet and the humorist his life and character and
genius deserved. When once this cultured squire exhibited for
criticism an elaborate manuscript, which in all the peace of leisured
wealth and ease, and such talent as he possessed, he had composed with
exquisite care, well might poor Goldsmith say:</p>

<p>"Ah, Mr. Craddock, think of me, that must
write a volume every month."</p>

<p><i>Rischgitz Collection.</i>]</p>
<span class="caption">2, BRICK COURT, TEMPLE, WHERE GOLDSMITH DIED.</span>
</div>

<p>In his rooms in Brick Court, Temple, Goldsmith used to sit at his
window, his eyes lingering lovingly upon the flowers and the foliage
in the gardens beneath, and his heart drinking in the sweet
peacefulness of the scene. He watched the Thames gliding on silently,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
serenely faithful to and fulfilling its great imperishable mission.
Rivers are the signs and the symbols of immortality. The poet saw the
rooks upon the lawns, and made new friends of these black-winged, busy
birds, and found angels' voices in the whispers of the rustling leaves
sweetly pleading. The flowers smiled up at him, as, gazing gently
down, he wreathed with welcomes all passing hearts amid many known and
unknown wanderers. There are those that have wondered, in the
inscrutable ordering of events, and feeling that strange chances take
their unexpected, often fulfilling, and often failing, part in these,
what had happened for letters and for humanity had Goldsmith met
Chatterton, who may have wearily paced the Temple Gardens, and even
have glanced up and seen Goldsmith looking down in all his tenderness.
In the literary history of this period the death of Chatterton darkens
the most painful page. At the time when this poor boy took his life
Goldsmith was not in London, and not even in England. He was in Paris.
The idea that had he encountered Chatterton it could hardly have
failed to be to the advantage, and possibly the redemption, and the
whole rescue of that young spirit, is not a charming conjecture that
has only flattery for its foundation. Oliver Goldsmith was one who
must perforce befriend the destitute. He could not let any hopeless
heart still keep its despair unmarked and not alleviated, if soothing
could prove possible. In
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
the year 1772, a youth named Macdonald, of Irish lineage, through the
sudden death of his elder brother, found himself friendless and alone
in London, and wandering, dejected and despairing, in the Temple
Gardens. Thus, too, Chatterton might have strayed in an even greater
loneliness. The ages of these youths were the same.</p>

<p>"Providence," writes Macdonald, "directed me to the Temple Gardens. I
threw myself on a seat, and willing to forget my miseries for a
moment, drew out a book. I had not been there long when a gentleman
strolling about passed near me, and observing, addressed me: 'Sir, you
seem studious. I hope you find this a favourable place.' Conversation
ensued. I told him my history. He gave me his address, and desired me
to call soon."</p>

<p>Goldsmith received him in the kindest manner. Macdonald became his
amanuensis. Goldsmith treated the young man throughout with unfailing
tenderness and sympathy and almost fatherly kindness and solicitude.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>CONSUMMATE COMEDY</h3>


<p>In 1771 Goldsmith was full of hope for that
capital essay in comedy, <i>She Stoops to Conquer</i>.
Two years passed before he could obtain
its definite acceptance. He found his manager
not in Garrick, as one might have anticipated,
but again in Colman. The pretty piece appeared
at Covent Garden. Tried as Goldsmith
had been ere <i>The Good-natured Man</i> was produced,
the negotiations and delays about <i>She
Stoops to Conquer</i> were not less torturing.
Colman kept the manuscript in his hands for
months and months without coming to any
decision. The playwright's letters to the
manager are absolute supplications. Humiliation
appears the very discipline of genius. At
one time the manuscript was actually recalled
by its author and despatched to Garrick.
Before it had really come under his consideration,
which very likely might have been just
as obtuse, Johnson intervened. To send it to
Garrick, in his opinion, would be tantamount to
an acknowledgment of its refusal by Colman.
This had not taken place. The manager would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
neither accept the piece nor produce it. He
said he would keep his faith, but whatever
that might mean in his mind, he did nothing.
Johnson finally and very firmly brought the
man to book. When Colman had accepted
the piece, through his gloomy forebodings he
biassed the actors against the play before they
had even seen it, but no sooner had the
rehearsals begun in earnest than they warmed
to their assigned parts, and in due time admired
and revelled in the comedy. Colman,
niggard, would risk nothing in the production
of the piece, neither in new costumes nor
theatrical fittings. He actually held forth
disparagingly in his own box-office to those
who sent to purchase tickets for the play.</p>

<p>In the Republic of Letters rumours of wrong
run like riot through the realm. Indignant
at Goldsmith's sufferings through Colman's
insults, and still more from their love of the
playwright, his friends determined that if
popular support and applause on the first night
could make his comedy succeed, then no effort
in this direction should be spared upon his
behalf. An illustrious and a memorable house
greeted the rising curtain. This assemblage of
celebrities and the men and women who loved
and admired and were resolved to stand by
and support Oliver Goldsmith was moving in
itself, and one of the greatest possible evidences
of the honour and popularity in which the
man was held. The people rallied to the
rescue of their favourite&mdash;the best beloved of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
all the authors. This is one of the finest
demonstrations of public sympathy and regard
the history of literature affords. It was enough
for Oliver Goldsmith to have lived for that
night, and, if need be, for that alone. The
whole affair proved an unequivocal success.
Those friends, bent on conquest, applauded
everything, and led the streams of welcoming
mirth and merriment. The fact that the
comedy did not require this protection could
not make the personal kindliness less pleasing.
Johnson, Burke, Reynolds, Stevens, Fitzherbert,
and a rallying host, dined together before proceeding
to the theatre. Johnson led them like
a commander-in-chief. The hearty meal at
the Shakespeare Tavern was one of the most
jovial imaginable. The party mustered on the
battle-field. It was Goldsmith's Waterloo.
That great victory, like the triumph of <i>She
Stoops to Conquer</i>, was assured ere it was fought.
Goldsmith, very nervous at the dinner, did not
go at once to the theatre, but strolled away,
and rambled alone in St. James's Park. He
crept back, or, rather, was persuaded by
Stevens to come, and arrived at the opening of
the fifth act. Strangely enough, as he entered
he caught the only sign of disapproval heard
that night.</p>

<p><i>She Stoops to Conquer</i>, owing much to its
capital central motive, is as graceful as it
is diverting. Its humour is unfailing. The
delightful force of Goldsmith's dialogue lies in
entire naturalness. The author of "The School
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
for Scandal" creates for his comedies an atmosphere
of superheated wit and intellectualism,
which, whilst inevitably pleasing, is beyond
probability. Certain novelists vaunt and revel
in the creation of impossibly vivacious wits.
Nature has a finer grace; its faithful reflection
is purer art. Those true to natural humour
and the spontaneous rather than the fabricated
repartee represent a small minority. Amongst
the novelists Goldsmith and Jane Austen
have few to follow them, and with the dramatists
Moli&egrave;re and Pinero are almost his solitary
associates. Perfectly natural are the arguments,
'mid trips and assaults, between Mr.
Burchell and Mrs. Primrose in <i>The Vicar of
Wakefield</i>, and Hastings and Mrs. Hardcastle
in <i>She Stoops to Conquer</i>. This play
achieved a revolution in dramatic presentation.
It changed the course of comedy, heightened
humour, and rang like laughter round the
town. It was performed as long as there were
nights to spare. In book-form it proved a
great success. In this we have the beautiful
words of the dedication to Dr. Johnson. The
town was disgusted to the depths with Colman.
No one will ever pity him for the private contempt
and the public derision he brought upon
himself through his mean discernment and his
want of appreciation of the very best play of
the period. The press so teemed with caustic
and sarcastic epigrams at his expense that he
fled for refuge to Bath during the run of the
piece, and at last begged Goldsmith to intercede
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
and rescue him from the scorn of the
critics. After all the worries and vexations,
it is not surprising that poor Noll should write:
"I am sick of the stage!"</p>

<p>When it was known that the King would
visit the theatre to see <i>She Stoops to
Conquer</i>, he said: "I wish he would;" and
then added, carried away by the undercurrent
of pressing trials: "Not that it would do me
the least good." "Then," said Johnson, "let
us hope that it will do him good."</p>

<p>The interval in time was not wide that
divided the last triumph from the last day of
Goldsmith's life. He was still toiling amid
many monetary perplexities, that he had not
bettered by accepting payment for works before
they were completed. It was now all pouring
out and nothing coming in, and there was no
hope. He projected a <i>Dictionary of Arts and
Sciences</i> upon a comprehensive system, at once
practical and ambitious. Failing health had
made him sadly dilatory. The booksellers,
who had lost confidence in his schemes, did
not hold him the man for this encyclop&aelig;dic
labour or suited for long and strenuous strain.
Friends ineffectually tried to procure him a
pension. He had made many notes and
written sundry essays, intended for a treatise
in two volumes, to be entitled <i>A Survey of Experimental
Philosophy</i>. In the midst of vain strivings
he died. The knack of hoping could not do all.
The heart was broken and the soul passing.
It is a tragedy to remember that his one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
chance lay now in writing another comedy.
In these distressed days Garrick came to his
aid, helping him over one stile, at least, by
paying liberally, and probably from charity, for
the promise of a play. The poet's physical
strength was poorer even than his empty
purse. In this sad state he pursued his
labours, toiling like a slave almost to the last,
looking back and recovering nothing, forward
and seeing nothing, pressing on with all the
poor power he had left, and making no headway.
He gave one last extravagant dinner to his old
friends, which in his poverty, and for very
shame and pity, and a little even in rebuke,
they would not take at his expense. Then for
a time he sought once again the fresh, sweet
country air. He returned to town. The
old talent was not yet fled. He wrote that
fine <i>Retaliation</i> at this time. It is pathetically
possible that the weakening appearance of
the poet induced his lively friends to pen
epitaphs upon the little man. Many jests
have their serious motives, not wholly known
to those who perpetrate the jokes. If unconscious
of the forces really leading to the episode,
little did they dream that its results would live
till now, and to all intents for ever. Each
wrote an epitaph on Noll, and he in turn an
epitaph on all. The <i>Retaliation</i> shows his
power in compressed expression, and his fine
discernment of men and character. The little
poem lives, a veritable, and, in its way, a wholesale
contribution to national biography. It is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
a candid commentary upon some of the best
men of that day. Garrick is treated more
elaborately than the rest. He had been the
prime offender, and naturally came foremost
for the fire of the reply. The poem was never
finished. The kind words about Sir Joshua
were practically the last the poet penned.
Reynolds, to the very end trying to cheer
Goldsmith and be with him whenever he could,
proved now, as he had ever been, the sweetest
of friends&mdash;a true and loving, tender man.</p>

<p>Home at the Temple, and in the dear London
he loved, Goldsmith grew ill very rapidly, and
in his illness fell into a deep sleep. He slept
to wake; he stooped to conquer. This, instead
of being the sleep of restoring strength, was
that in which disease takes its last, firm grasp.
One struggle with the feeble frame, and the
wrestle for life was over for ever. His
biographers write of this sleep, that was
watched with so much anxiety by his physicians:
"It was hoped that a favourable crisis
had arrived." It had. It marked the advent
of the last reprieve, that release that can never
be recalled. The clouds have passed away for
ever, and in the sunshine came the solace of
all cares, the finality of pain, and the soothing
and the solution of all sorrow. Heaven had
sent its last call and its greatest message to the
heart. In all, only forty-seven years had been
given, and all that may have been ill in the
time is forgotten and forgiven, and the fairest
part of all that was well and high and true is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
with us even now, and the radiance must last
for long, cheering many hearts, brightening
souls that are failing, and blessing homes that
are and will be. The night of passing death
has led on to the day of unpassing life.</p>

<p>On April 4, 1774, the spirit of Oliver Goldsmith
conquered that which men call death.
Burke burst into tears at the news of the
passing of the man and the friend he cherished
and revered. Reynolds laid his work aside
and rose, shaken in his great sorrow, and
trembling with the sense of an untold loss.
Looking back upon the fading figure, so dear
to so many, and a light for years to come,
shining still in many homes and many hearts
and many lands, Johnson, in his sacred
solemnity, said: "Poor Goldsmith! He was
a very great man."</p>

<p>The body of Oliver Goldsmith was buried in the quiet Temple
churchyard. There is a tablet to his memory in the church itself, but
no one now knows exactly where the mortal remnant was laid, for no
memorial marked that last resting-place. The epitaph on Goldsmith in
Westminster Abbey runs: "He left no spheres of writing untouched or
unadorned by his pen. Noble, pure, and delicate, his memory will last
as long as society retains affection, friendship is not devoid
of honour, and reading wants not her admirers." Intimately we
are guided most of all by those whom most we love. The eyes may
close, but not the life. There is the knowledge of loving power
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
wielded on the heart by those whom men call dead. There is a soul in
men rising beyond visible activities; its story is not told in the
recognised deeds of a career and their outward record. Beyond the
acknowledged actions and admitted attainments, there stays the
prevailing essence. The glory of Christianity is seen in its
illuminating stars, living everlastingly. Through grace and
gentleness, Goldsmith was one in that long train in which shine Sister
Dora and St. Francis of Assisi.</p>

<p>Oliver Goldsmith was the most pure and
suasive spirit of his age. To this day his
gentle touch and soothing spell, by that magnetic
power that flows through purity of sympathy,
still sway the heart. His charming
radiance and pure, divine delight move and
master those who admire and honour this
all-loving soul and most graceful writer. In
reading his works, there is for all, and there
must ever be, that sense of compassion and
that absolving perception which must have
moved the finer feelings of those who lived in
his own time, and actually knew the man himself.
Not less does his purifying power, with
its elevating inspiration, survive. It is a silent
and unseen, but still a lofty, a lasting, and an
impressive influence. Lovers of Goldsmith feel
friendship and affection for the moving and
immortal spirit of the man. His works need
no learned commentary. The common heart is
their sufficing commentary.</p>

<h3>THE POET AND THE ESSAYIST</h3>


<p>Successful in every sphere, it is as
an essayist that, amongst the immortals,
Goldsmith sways signal and supreme distinction.
As a poet, not less than as a playwright,
he triumphed in his own, and inspired and
influenced the coming age. As a biographer,
he readily gained contemporary celebrity, both
through the sympathetic understanding of his
heart and the delightful facility of his literary
style. In his own time, he occupied, through
the high and undoubted merits of his works, an
eminent position amongst the historians. The
appealing force of his power in this field has
lasted practically until the present day. That
his histories have been superseded is due far
more to changes in attitude and criticism and
the revolutionary results of modern research
than to intrinsic failures in the works themselves.
They still stand monuments in pure
English and models in patriotic perception,
the due balance between the general and the
particular, and also in vividness, compression,
and an unfailing clearness, both in sound views,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
and also in their unfailing explicit expression.
Whilst it has appeared the unhappy destiny of
this author to have been at times too lightly
regarded, high praise has almost always been
accorded to his labours.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott writes: "The wreath of
Goldsmith is unsullied; he wrote to exalt virtue
and expose vice; and he accomplished his task
in a manner that raises him to the highest rank
among British authors. We close his volumes
with a sigh that such an author should have
written so little from the stores of his own
genius, and that he should have been so prematurely
removed from the sphere of literature
which he adorned." Johnson writes: "The Life
of Dr. Parnell is a task which I should very
willingly decline, since it has been lately written
by Goldsmith&mdash;a man of such variety of powers,
and such felicity of performance, that he always
seemed to do best that which he was doing.
What such an author has told, who would wish
to tell again?" The same generous soul exclaimed:
"Is there a man, sir, now, who can
pen an essay with such ease and elegance as
Goldsmith?" All can see how true this is
when they compare Goldsmith's style with that
of his contemporaries&mdash;that hostile essay, for
example, published from Richardson's firm, in
which, time after time, sneers must cease and
praise prevail, despite the intention to decry.
If reluctant laudation is most sincere, then
Boswell himself said of Goldsmith that there
was nothing that he touched that he did not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
adorn. Goldsmith adorned, but not with mere
polish or veneer. He threw a curious felicity
on things, and made them fair. The very
beauty of his touch allures us to take his work
too lightly. If his essays had been in his own
time translated into pompous terms, he could
have passed for a sage. As convention makes
religion something of which little children grow
afraid, so older minds think beauty must be
frivolous, and that moral worth must live in
rapt association with outward ugliness. A
most graceful literary style may be as true and
earnest and inspiring as a very pretty woman.
It teaches as it smiles. On everything Goldsmith
ever cast a fairer and more hallowed
light. The very inmost essence of his genius
was purity in its compassionate perfection. It
must, indeed, have been difficult under the
conditions of distress amidst which almost
throughout his whole life he wrote, for him to
preserve an ease of style, and with the ease a
dignity. Yet through all, not even once he
faltered. He never failed. Following Fielding's
happy epigram&mdash;if it ought not to be
rather called most unhappy&mdash;in these days the
lot of a literary man who was a hackney writer
was hardly better, nay, scarce as good, as the
lot of a hackney coachman. Yet even in those
writings which must have been rushed off most
rapidly, and amidst the fires of scorching distress,
Goldsmith maintained his grace of style,
and did not forget the reverence due to writing
and the honour of literature. Without any
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
trace or taint of self-consciousness or self-conceit,
he held the pen a sacred trust. As a
critic Goldsmith had a high ideal, and more
than this. And, what is finer, an entirely new
conception. No poet could read his criticism
of Gray and not feel inspired. No one could
peruse the article and not feel that henceforth
poetry was something more to him and to all
life than it had ever been before. Criticism is
itself among the evolving sciences. Depreciation
was rife. Goldsmith touched a new chord
in inspiring and chastening appreciation, a
spirit which even now, more and more, in life
and letters, men must realize. Unlike Brougham,
Goldsmith could chide without unkindness, and
prove severe without proving cruel. He threw
such a light of love on merit that could and
did soften and condone the deserved censure
of the strictures that not envy, but mercy,
made him utter. Criticism in its true sense
was hardly known. In enlarging the message
of poetry, the motive of the drama and the
functions of fiction, Goldsmith fulfilled the
responsibilities of higher criticism, and that
power of inspiration and heightening of expression
and perceptivity which are its first duty
and its highest honour. Whilst in the elevation
of criticism and the higher interpretation of
poetry much is due to the inspiring guidance of
Gray, a great deal, and more than is commonly
admitted, is due to Goldsmith. If he did not force,
he influenced the splendid expansion of spiritual
perception. It is as a writer of essays that on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Goldsmith falls the light of pure pre-eminence.
Some hold Charles Lamb supreme amongst
the essayists, and others Goldsmith, The last
men who would ever have fought for the vanity
of recognised supremacy would have been these
two gentle rival claimants for the crown. There
is a peculiar felicity in much of the writing of
Laurence Sterne. His demerits preclude him
from a sacred place. It is strange how rare
grace is in every sphere of art. In that of
gracious writing, Oliver Goldsmith, Charles
Lamb, and Nathaniel Hawthorne are alone in
pure and isolated splendour. We speak of
grace, and not here of power of mind or
informative force. How greatly Froude and
Emerson would be enhanced gifted with
graciousness. Goldsmith, even in his own day,
was acknowledged the best of the essay writers.
This is the realm in which he was, and is to
this day, king. From his love of poetry and
happiness in his art, and that shining in the
power of deft and delightful expression, there
is another sphere in which it would be expected
that his power would prevail, but in which he
had either no actual talent or very little. However
we may admire <i>The Haunch of Venison</i>
and other stray pieces, Goldsmith was really
not a writer of what is now called "Society
verse." In that delightful sphere Austin Dobson
has no rival. In the higher realms of poetry
there are many who will regret that necessity
forced Goldsmith to turn almost exclusively to
prose. Poetry loves genius, and starves it;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
whilst prose, hating, feeds and clothes its child.
Clearly genius, so much at ease in the essay,
would prosper in the poem. No one can
imagine when men will live and not love
Gray's "Elegy"; and if this be so, then for
as long, at least, there will be a place within
the heart for Goldsmith's <i>Deserted Village</i>.
Of <i>The Traveller</i>, Dr. Johnson said: "There
has not been so fine a poem since Pope's time."
This may seem poor praise. It was not so at
that time; Pope reigned supreme, and was
esteemed by Johnson at home, and Voltaire
abroad, as pre-eminent. Worshipping admirers
held Pope and Dryden very gods. Dryden and
Pope have passed away more easily than Gray
and Goldsmith will. In Dryden, Pope, and
Johnson himself we have mere imitators of
Latinity. They have no style or fashion that
can be wholly held their own, and without
Virgil, Juvenal, Horace, and Ovid they could
not have spoken. Goldsmith strikes a purer
strain, and one peculiarly his own and ours.
He is as English as Wordsworth. This makes
the comparison with Pope and Dryden now
most imperfect. Admitting so much, it almost
follows of necessity that Goldsmith was the
first poet of the rich and enriching school
that still sways the common heart, that gave
us Tennyson, Keats, Shelley, and an unrivalled
host in the history of poetic inspiration and
expression. It must, of course, be recognised
that Goldsmith was not the first to herald the
purely homely and an entirely indigenous note,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
since Gray was with him, and far earlier, Philip
Sydney had poured forth his fair and felicitous
melodies. Beyond, above, and greater far than
these, Milton, attuning his hallowed and harmonious
strains, through the classic chords of
Rome, had so faithfully fulfilled their inspiration
with moving majesty, that rising and
transcendently surpassing all his models, he
was, and is, in very deed unique, original,
unsupported, and supreme. <i>The Deserted Village</i>
was given to the world, but one cannot say
how long it lay hidden in the yearning heart
of that genius who gave it light and life. It
substantiated the fame of Goldsmith for ever
and unalterably. In the last year of his life,
Gray welcomed the piece, and was most moved
and grateful as he greeted it. It is as much
a part of our life as his own "Elegy," and
though each poem is distinct and could only
have been bestowed by the one heart of the
poet, who blessed himself and blessed the
lives of men in writing it, still there is a sweet
similitude.</p>

</div>

<p>The highest praise that one could give Gray
and Goldsmith is to hold their genius and their
influence kindred. There is, however, a glistening
and Chaucerian brightness and vitality in
Goldsmith not discernible in Gray. Their
kindredness is thus that of the vernal unto the
autumnal light. In <i>The Deserted Village</i>, from
its whole reflective vein, at a glance we must
perceive that long these loved and loving
thoughts had lingered in the mind and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
heart of the poet. Sparks from Heaven fell
upon the tinder of the yearnings of the lowly
heart. At last the glow was seen, and grew a
light distinct. There is a moulding, moving
music of the mind. Swiftly, in time, line after
line found its place within the common heart
and life. Again, as in earlier days, we see the
spiritual spell, and with the force, the form and
understanding, fathoming stretch and reach and
power and grasp of genius.</p>

<p>The sublimity of the spirit of Shakespeare and the aloofness of the
mind of Milton divide their influence, through an infinite
universality, from the current of evolving expression. Goldsmith was
one in the great succession of the dynasty of poetry that must outlast
the nation and the race. In the line of this successive sovereignty
the name of Chaucer is first inscribed, and that of the towering
Browning is now seen the last upon the glorious list of the kings of
poetry. If Gray's "Elegy" came close to the outward beauty and the
inmost heart of nature, the same must be said of Goldsmith's <i>Deserted
Village</i>. From the heart and life of nature, poetry has now passed to
the heart and life of man. That first natural interpretation that
gained its meridian glory through Wordsworth, and its bright, vivid,
yet evening radiance in the sweet spirit of the dulcet Tennyson, knew
its dawn through the love-lit lines of Gray and Goldsmith.</p>

<p><i>The Deserted Village</i> appeared soon after the
production of <i>The Good-natured Man</i> in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
moving and marvellous procession of Oliver
Goldsmith's great and successive achievements.
The poem was dedicated to Sir Joshua
Reynolds, who was as rejoiced and grateful as
only a true friend could be. The artist could
admire the piece profoundly, but still not more
sincerely than Edmund Burke, the statesman
and the orator. As Tennyson had a lilt and
Byron a sentiment, swiftly and easily appealing,
consciously or unconsciously caught, and sincerely
felt or insincerely imitated, so Goldsmith
possessed a teaching charm and a guiding grace
that can be traced in many later poets and
amongst the works of greatest minds, in the
poetry of Robert Burns. Poets, like priests,
teach the hearts and lives of men, the means
and power of their expression. One may cull
from Goldsmith his own sublime simile:</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"And, as a bird, each fond endearment tries<br />
To tempt its new-fledged offspring to the skies,<br />
He tried each art, reproved each dull delay,<br />
Allured to brighter worlds, and led the way."<br />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>THE LIGHT OF LOVE</h3>


<p>To think of Oliver Goldsmith is to feel him
near&mdash;a friend, and the brightest of
friends. This is the spell that still he sways.
His words are semblant to moving memories.
His genius purifies the clouds of life, and cheers
and inspires the heavy-laden heart. One cannot
tell what was, and is, the hidden charm that
gave and gives for ever this appealing influence.
It may be touching simplicity. It may have
been his sacrifice and deep devotion, or that
kindly affectionateness which is itself sublime.
It might be that pretty gift, the joyousness of
innocence. It is radiant to remember Goldsmith's
love of life, and its pleasures and
adventures. He loved the town. He loved
the country. He loved the rich. He loved
the poor, the crude, the cultured, the pious, and
the base. He was a philanthropist. It kept
him poor. He was, in all his struggles, ever
a patron of literature. No striving aspirant
pleaded for his munificence in vain. If his old
friends in Ireland came to London, he housed,
fed, and clothed them. No beggar in the street
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
could pass without recognition. It was all one
to this pure benevolence whether the gift was
rendered in gold or copper. The beggar who
sought a penny could, no doubt, find room for
a guinea, if need be, just as easily in some poor
pocket hidden in his deserved rags and tatters.
Goldsmith taught that great lesson that, after all,
the undeserving most deserve compassion. So
completely is Goldsmith bound up in his works,
that as you fondly press the cherished volume
of all that he gave that was best, the heart
of the man beats with yours, and in an immortal
friendship his life and hope and spirit are your
own. His many and most varied intimacies
reveal a genius for companionability, whilst
his higher and deeper unions show equally his
force in friendship, that great grace which few
attain.</p>

<p>Everyone became swiftly fond of him and he as fond of everyone. Unlike
Socrates and Dr. Johnson, Goldsmith loved the fields and the
countryside. He roamed and rambled everywhere. Hardly a county seemed
to him quite unknown, from Surrey to Yorkshire. He wandered West: Bath
lives hallowed through his visits to the place. With the bright and
beautiful Misses Horneck and their widowed mother he went again to
France, doubtless often laughingly recalling his earlier travels and
their troubles, telling much and hiding more, with the very poverty of
the past now proving the rich treasures of the present. All hardships
were melted to deep delights in merry reminiscence,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
Oliver Goldsmith, loving the Horneck girls much as Horace Walpole
cherished in his heart the beautiful Misses Berry, had nicknames for
these daughters of his gentle hostess, the elder being Little Comedy,
and the younger the Jessamy Bride. If ever Goldsmith loved anyone, he
loved the Jessamy Bride. The sweet girl was bewitching, gentle, and
innocent, bright, and very young, and that chivalrous and tender soul
that honoured her with his devotion a prematurely bent and aged man of
more than forty summers. Her wifely affections were early destined for
another heart. From the beginning, come what may, she could never be
Oliver Goldsmith's wife. The Jessamy Bride was a pure and lovely
spirit. No poet was ever moved in reverence for a fairer
personification of a pure ideal.</p>

<p>It was a most stately, graceful, gracious, and
fascinating very old lady whom, when years,
and many years, had come and gone, Hazlitt
met and greeted. Still she remembered and
still she revered the loved and moving heart of
Oliver Goldsmith. It is his greatness, and it
is his glory that his soul could and did appeal
to the sublime spirit of pure womanhood. Of
none could greater, or more than this be said.
Man need not crave for more, or aspire on earth
to purer heights. It was beautiful to know,
and to be the friend of, and it was divine to be
remembered by, the Jessamy Bride. These
two made merry when they met. Laughing
eyes danced. All was pure, spontaneous revelry.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
These two were the source and centre of mirth
and cheerfulness. Partly he amused, and partly
enticed reverence and respect. The outward
laughter moved, but depth of life and love drew
heart to heart. This sunshine was most fair.
As it was, Goldsmith knew the last loneliness
of things, and lived a single life and died in
solitude. In Oliver Goldsmith, Washington
Irving says: "Eminent ability was allied with
spotless virtue." He sympathetically suggests
how home, wife, and children would have
softened those ills that came from solitude and
enriched what was at once an abundant, and
yet still, in some respects, an impoverished
nature.</p>
